# Moxy Sensor Python script to read from device

This guide has been prepared to enable the Python developers to connect to the device then, pull the data and decode the it.
There is an article published on mdpi with the title : Muscle Oxygen Desaturation and Re-Saturation Capacity Limits in Repeated Sprint Ability Performance in Women Soccer Players: A New Physiological Interpretation. (https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/7/3484)

I have created this tutorial to help the developers use Python to decode Hear Rate and Muscle Oxygentation (SmO2) factors.
